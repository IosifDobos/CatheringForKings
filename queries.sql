/*	Each student should write individual queries that show the following:
	Selection, Projection, Aggregation with filters on aggregates, Union, Minus, Difference, Inner Join, Outer Join, Semi-join, Anti-join and Correlated sub-query.
	Each query should be tested to ensure that there is data there to satisfy it and to show that it works â€“ i.e. a query that shows the power of the technique being used (e.g. a left join that would return the same as an inner join will not get full marks). You may create views as required but show your code if you do.
